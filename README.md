# python-scripts

In this repository, I keep Python scripts that I use to do tasks related to my work on the Dutch newspaper collection

The newspaper filter scripts removed duplicated entries that exist within the corpus

The extract entities script counts the number of tagged entities after Named Entity Recognition, and exports this as a CSV.
